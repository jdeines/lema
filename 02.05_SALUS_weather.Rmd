Goal: Create SALUS weather input (.wdb.xml) using an automated approach that, based on a shapefile region of interest (roi): 

* extracts NLDAS grid cell polygons with centroid coordinates as attribute data
* clips this to the roi
* joins mean elevation to each NLDAS grid cell
* exports NLDAS polygons in the roi for downstream distribution of SALUS results
* ...not sure the end point yet.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path='figure/02.00_SALUS_bounds/',
                      cache = TRUE)
```

**R Packages Needed**

```{r packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(sf)
```

## User Variables and Directories

```{r userVars}
#boundaryShapefile <- 
```
